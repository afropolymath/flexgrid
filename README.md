# Flexgrid
Flexgrid is a flexbox based CSS Layout System. It's simple and easy to use and can be used on it's own or with any other CSS framework.

##Usage
To use Flexgrid, all you need to do is embed the compiled CSS within your web page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/flexgrid.min.css" />
```

##Getting Started
To get started using the flex features you can create a parent flex container using the `flex` class

```html
<div class="flex">
  <!-- Some random content -->
</div>
```

To align the child elements in rows or columns, you can make use of the `row-layout` and `column-layout` classes respectively.

```html
<div class="flex row-layout">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

To arrange child elements in a column
```html
<div class="flex column-layout">
  <div>Stacked element</div>
  <div>Stacked element</div>
</div>
```

Some other operations you can perform include aligning child elements in the vertical and horizontal axes. To align the child elements in the vertical axis, you will be using a base class of `vertical`. This class is used in conjunction with another class which specifies how the alignment should be.

*Align Child Elements in the vertical center*
```html
<div class="flex row-layout vertical align-center">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

*Align Child Elements in the vertical top*
```html
<div class="flex row-layout vertical align-top">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

*Align Child Elements in the vertical bottom*
```html
<div class="flex row-layout vertical align-bottom">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

Horizontal alignment is similar to vertical alignment but we make use of a base class of `horizontal` along with another class that specifies the horizontal direction.

*Align Child Elements in the horizontal left*
```html
<div class="flex row-layout horizontal align-left">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

*Align Child Elements in the horizontal center*
```html
<div class="flex row-layout horizontal align-center">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

*Align Child Elements in the horizontal right*
```html
<div class="flex row-layout horizontal align-right">
  <div>Side by side element</div>
  <div>Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

At any point in time, if we need to make a child element fill up space in the parent, use the `fill` class. A typical example would be if we need to create a simple navigation bar with a logo and some other text. Using **Flexgrid** you could do this:

```html
<div class="flex row-layout">
  <div class="logo">Logo</div>
  <div class="fill">Side by side element</div>
</div>
```

In this example above, the `logo` div has a fixed size which is set in the CSS, while the other div is made to fill up all the remainder space in the parent div.

You can use this class to create different types of layouts. A typical example will be creating a 4 column grid with evenly sized columns. You can do this very easily with Flexgrid. All you need to do is set `fill` on all classes below the parent.

```html
<div class="flex row-layout">
  <div class="fill">Side by side element</div>
  <div class="fill">Side by side element</div>
  <div class="fill">Side by side element</div>
  <div class="fill">Side by side element</div>
</div>
```
